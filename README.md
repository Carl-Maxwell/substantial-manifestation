Substantial Manifestation
========

A simple first person WebGL thing, very early work in progress at the moment.

Uses Three JS for rendering.

To run locally do:

```bash
chmod +X ./utils/servers/ruby_server.sh
./utils/servers/ruby_server.sh
```

That should get a server hosting it on http://localhost:8000

## Theory of this project

This is a highly experimental project, the idea here is to ignore performance and just play around with javascript syntax and libraries.

It's based upon an older project of mine that was similar https://github.com/Carl-Maxwell/scramble-daggers (these project names were randomly generated)
