Substantial Manifestation
========

A simple first person WebGL thing, very early work in progress at the moment.

Uses Three JS for rendering.

To run locally do:

```shell
chmod +X ./utils/servers/ruby_server.sh
./utils/servers/ruby_server.sh
```

That should get a server hosting it on http://localhost:8000
