Substantial Manifestation
========

A simple first person WebGL thing, very early work in progress at the moment.

Uses Three JS for rendering.

To run locally do:

```shell
chmod +X ./utils/servers/ruby_server.sh
./utils/servers/ruby_server.sh
```

That should get a server hosting it on http://localhost:8000

## Theory of this project

This is a highly experimental project, the idea here is to ignore performance and just mess around with syntax.

It's based upon an older project of mine that was similar https://github.com/Carl-Maxwell/scramble-daggers (these project names were randomly generated)
